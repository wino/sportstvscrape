# sportstvscrape
This script will scrape a website (like ESPN) containing a daily/weekly schedule for a particular sport (e.g. NCAAF) and pull out the teams, time, and tv station for the games that will be on given tv stations (including ESPN+ streaming). It prints out this information in an easily copy-pastable way, including converting tv logos into text names.

I created this for keeping track of all of the recorded games that I would like to watch after-the-fact on YouTube TV, since it will record every single game and there are way too many to sift through. I can copy-paste the schedule into a spreadsheet once per week and still be able to look at it after games have been played without seeing the scores by looking at the espn site.
